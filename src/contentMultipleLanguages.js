                I assume you were expecting a good looking animated thing, because that's what you've seen so far (or, if you saw this website first on your PC, you've seen an amazing globe and the transition to it from the plane (I bet you loved it &#60;3)), but instead you are seeing this <i>thing</i>. <br/><br/>
                Well, there was supposed to be a gorgeous Earth that spinned around, had a red low-polly texture and even had markers on the places I've visited, but... the mobiles couldn't handle it :( <br/><br/>
                
                But WORRY NOT! I've got you covered! I always have a solution! :D <br/><br/>
                
                <strike>I've implemented a super-fast and super-efficient animated globe that lets you put markers on it AND WORKS ON ANY MOBILE</strike> <br/><br/>
                Here's a 2-minute sketch of the globe that I made on my tablet: <br/><br/>`,
                pt2: `With this spectacular drawing, you can <b>use your imagination</b> to imagine the fantastic globe! <br/><br/>
                    
                So much better, am I right? :D <br/><br/>
                
                Alternatively, you can see the Earth on your PC. I bet you will love it (but not more than my drawing). <br/><br/>
