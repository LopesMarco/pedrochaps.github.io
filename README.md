<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# My website

Welcome to the README of my website! :D

I've always seen beautiful websites scattered across the internet and one of my dreams was to have my own.  

So, in the university summer break of 2022, inspired by one of my classes' project and by coursemates websites (like @diogotcorreia [website](https://diogotc.com/) and  @jjasferreira [website](https://github.com/jjasferreira/my-website)) and the beautiful websites I've seen on the web, I decided to learn Web Development and create my personal website!  

Since I had pratically 0 experience with web styling, I've documented: 
- a roadmap that I had previously created some time before starting;
- a "step-by-step" journey / timeline of what I learned, where I learned and how I used what I learned;
- a general / technical overview of the website, where I explain stuff like the frameworks used;

This way, I'll help myself by writting down everything I've done and my ideas as well as other people who intend to create a website themselves and are as lost as I was when I first started.   
I'm obviously no where near a professional, but I'll do my best to explain what I did and the decisions I took.

Here is a table of contents:  
    ðŸš§ TODO Create table of contents ðŸš§


# Roadmap 

ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§

# Timeline of what I did

## 0. My background in WebDev

First, I think it is important to state what my background is in Web Development.  
Before this project, I had only done 2 other projects related to web:  

1. A web app using the Django Framework to interact with APIs.  
    Here I learned the basics of HTML and went straight to Bootstrap without giving a look to CSS, however the main focus was the app itself any not styling the website, so I didn't really learn much.
    
2. A web app using the Flask Framework to interact with a database.  
    One of my classes' project was to do many things related to a database. Since I was the only member of the group with prior experience of the group, I was in charge of the web app that was required.  
    I re-used the same principles of the first app: I used bootstrap for the design and some html "stolen" from the classes slides and, once again, the main objective was using the interaction with the database and not the style itself, so I didn't learn much about styling.
   
## 1. The Basics  

Since my knownledge was really low, I started by learning (or reviewing) the basics: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  

However, I decided to not put much effort into it - Since I understood the ideas, had some small prior experience and was expecting to use frameworks for CSS and JavaScript, I decided that only reading about the basics would suffice, without really applying what I had learned.  

So, what I did was read the [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) guides: [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp), by that order.  

## 2. Choosing frameworks

Having read the basics, it was time to choose a framework for CSS and JavaScript.  
Although it wasn't necessary to, I decided that they would most likely help and learning a bit of everything wouldn't hurt so I forced myself to use frameworks.

### CSS - Tailwind

From the dozens that are available, I was kind of lost on which to use.  
I had already excluded Bootstrap because I wanted to learn something new and Bootstrap wasn't that customizable.  
So by googling a bit and following @jjasferreira 's idea I decided to use Tailwind.  

From what I gathered, Tailwind is highly customizable - it's like writing pure CSS but faster (and not using pre-built complex classes) - but also has some neat features, like Dark Mode, components, etc.  

### Javascript - React  

This was a though one to choose.  
I'll be honest and say that it was kind of a random choice.  
I had already seen some videos of people using three.js for 3d graphics, so I planning to use it, and since React had a "Reach Three Fiber" that is a wrapper for three.js, I decided to learn this framework.


## 3. Learn the frameworks

Having chosen the frameworks, it was time to learn them! 
This time I decided to, besides reading, see videos instead of reading about the content. I watched the following videos and read the following content (in the presented order):  

### Tailwind

- [Firebase overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfaSUYaSgRo);
- [Tailwind Docs](ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§): This was my main way of learning Tailwind, because the Docs are very well written! While coding I would also check the Docs very often; 

### React

- [ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY&list=WL&index=46;
- ðŸš§ TODO Adicionar mais info ðŸš§ 
- ðŸš§ TODO Coisas de R3F, docs e dizer q tive q ver muitos videos pq confundi-me com as docs ðŸš§

## 4. Sketch Ideas

I started sketching some basic ideias of the layout of the website - This is an important step in the making, because it makes your ideas clearer and if it really complete, you basically just have to "match" the design with what you've drawn. Here are the pictures of what I drew:

ðŸš§ TODO Meter fotos das imagens do tablet ðŸš§

## 5. Navbar  

Now having some theory and ideas set, it was time to start coding!  
I had already some ideias in mind that I had previously thought would look nice, so I started implementing them first.  
The first feature was the Navbar. I wanted a Navbar that wouldn't look like a Navbar at first but as the user scrolled, it would snap in place, staying at the top of the page - that could be accomplished with the `sticky` class from Tailwind.  
Besides an interactive Navbar, I also wanted the buttons in it to look a certain way. I had seen the following video 
ðŸš§ TODO Meter video ðŸš§
and I felt in love with the buttons; I had to have something similar in my website!  
So, talking inspiration from the video, the final Navbar was the following:

ðŸš§ TODO Meter fotos da Navbar nos diferentes estados, sem o estado ativo ðŸš§

On mobile devices, I thought it was better to just let the Navbar stay fixed at the bottom of the page, because it's more easily clickable. So this was the result in mobile:

ðŸš§ TODO fotos navbar tlm ðŸš§

## 6. Header / Home / About me  

After having the Navbar, the next step was creating the Home part , which would also be the "About me" part of the website. I had already planned to have four main components:   
1. My name written with a special effect;
2. An image of me (which was later changed to an animated avatar);
3. A small phrase that identifies me;
4. A biography of myself;  

Then the Navbar would be at the bottom of the Header, which made it look like it was part of the the Header.  
I decided to use a random background I had found that was just temporary.  
Out of the four, the most interesting one is the 1. .

### 6.1 Typewritter Effect 

I wanted to have my name written with a special effect and I had previously seen a typewritter effect on text, that is, the text appears being written slowly, one letter at a time.  
I started implementing it myself but after searching for videos that showed the effect, I stumbled upon this implementation ðŸš§ TODO Linkar implementaÃ§Ã£o ðŸš§ that was exactly what I was thinking of!   
So, I decided to use it.  

## 7. Low Polly Plane  

Besides the amazing Navbar, the other feature I really wanted the website to have was a moving Low Polly Plane.  
I had seen this design in many places and I really enjoyed it.  

At first, I was planning to use a video as background, like this one:   
ðŸš§ TODO meter video ðŸš§    
but as I was searching THREE.js tutorials on youtube, I stumbled upon this video:   
ðŸš§ TODO meter video ðŸš§  
And it was EXACTLY what I was looking for: An animated Low Polly Plane that even had mouse interaction!  
So, I took a big inspiration from it and created a very similar version.  
Note that the implementation above uses [THREE.js](ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§) while what I did was with [React-Thee-Fiber](ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§), a React wrapper of THREE.js, which means that if look at the code I wrote, it will look very different that what is on the video.

At first, this plane was the background of the General Experience tab, but it was later moved.  
Here are some screenshots of it:
ðŸš§ TODO meter fotos ðŸš§

## 8. Zoom out text
While creating the plane, an idea of zooming out from a piece of text appeared on my mind.    

I thought it would look cool at the end of the website, asking the user if he liked what he saw and then presenting the ways he can contact me (and other final information).  
The way I did it was by getting the user's current scroll position and changing the position of the text based on the scroll value (that is, the z-position of the text was a function of the scroll position).      
To generate the text inside a Canvas, I used [Drei's text](ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§).  

I then also added some lighting changes as the user continued scrolling, in order to make it even more interactive!   

This was the final result:
ðŸš§ TODO meter fotos ðŸš§

## 9. Active Button & Smooth Scroll

Currently I had a Navbar and some content BUT the buttons on it didn't do anything!  
I wanted them to besides taking the user to the appropriate section, do it smoothly. I also wanted the current section's button to light up once the user enters it. 

While googling the best way to implement this, I was lucky to find this [amazing video](ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§) that uses the [ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§ package](ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§) and explains exactly what how to implement what I wanted.

The buttons started looking like this:
ðŸš§ TODO Meter fotos ðŸš§ 

## 10. Planet Earth
Note that up until this point I didn't really have a theme for my website.  

I just knew that I wanted an interactive Navbar with those gorgeous buttons and that I wanted a Low Polly moving Plane but at this point I didn't know what to do next: I didn't want to include random stuff  on my website just because they looked cool, I wanted it to have some meaning.  

After thinking and looking at other people's websites, I found this [interesting package](ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§) that implemented a Globe and had many interesting visualization features.  
One of the features was using HTML in the globe, like putting markers in specific coordinates.  

With that, I had an interesting idea: I could use this globe on the "Hobbies and Achivements" section and mark the countries I have visited.

Then, I had an amazing idea: 
> What if that *random* plane was actually the zoomed-in surface of earth and as the user scrolled, the plane would zoom out and the planed would appear?  

That sounded AMAZING in my head and could just well be the theme of the website - **Space**! 

I created a texture that looked like the geometry used on the plane and used it on the planet.  
Then I found [this package](ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§) that easily tells the user's current scroll position across some part or all of the document.  
As soon as the user crossed a certain threshold, the plane would start moving down and the animation of Earth would kick in, zooming out of the planet.  

Even though it's clear where the Plane and the Globe separate, I think it's fluid enough if the user is scrolling smoothly. I'm very happy with the result!  

ðŸš§ TODO Fotos ðŸš§


## 11. Other planets 

Because of the previous idea I had, I needed to move the Plane to the "Career and Education" section. That mean't the "General Experience" section was currently empty.   

Since the theme (**Space**) was now defined, I thought it was nice to include the planets that come before Earth as well as the Moon flying across the plane - it would make sense theme-wise and I could play a bit with the animations.     

So, I added Mercury, Venus and the Moon and some reaction to the scroll movement:
- Mercury and Venus rotate as the user scrolls;
- The Moon rotates and moves across the plane, as if it was orbiting Earth. 

This was nothing special comparing to the Plane or the Globe, just three R3F meshes of which the rotation/position depends on the scroll percentage of the website.

This reaction makes the website a bit more interactive, which is always welcome!

It ended up looking like this:  
ðŸš§ TODO fotos dos planetas ðŸš§

## 12. Animated Avatar

While looking for ideias, I found this [really cool article](ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§) that explains how you can create an Avatar of yourself, animate it and use it on your website.  

I thought an animated Avatar would look more interesting than a photo of myself, so I decided to switch it.  

The final result was this:  
ðŸš§ TODO fotos avatar ðŸš§
